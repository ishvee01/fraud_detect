Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model 
with Dashboard 

Project Overview:

The Financial Fraud Detection Model utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Data 
Analytics to identify suspicious transactions, detect fraudulent activities, and provide real
time insights via an interactive dashboard. This system is essential for banks, fintech 
companies, and financial institutions to mitigate risks and prevent financial fraud. 

Key Features:

1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing 
 Collect transactional data from banking systems, payment gateways, and financial 
records. 
 Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. 
 Handle missing values and apply data normalization techniques. 
 Feature engineering to extract behavioral patterns and anomalies. 
2. Fraud Detection Algorithms 
 Supervised Learning Models: 
o Logistic Regression 
o Decision Trees & Random Forest 
o Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) 
 Unsupervised Learning Models: 
o Isolation Forest 
o One-Class SVM 
o Autoencoders (Deep Learning-based anomaly detection) 
 Graph-Based Analysis: 
o Detecting fraudulent networks and relationships between entities. 
3. Real-Time Fraud Monitoring 
 Stream transaction data using Apache Kafka / Spark Streaming. 
 Implement an alerting system for high-risk transactions.

 Adaptive learning mechanism to improve fraud detection accuracy over time. 
4. Interactive Dashboard & Reporting 
 Real-time fraud visualization using heatmaps, bar charts, and anomaly scores. 
   
Future Enhancements 
 AI-driven risk scoring for customer creditworthiness. 
 Blockchain-based fraud prevention system. 
 Mobile app integration for instant fraud alerts.
